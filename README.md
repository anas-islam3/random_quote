# Random Quote Generator

A simple web application that fetches and displays random quotes. Users can get a new random quote by clicking a button. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and the use of promises to handle asynchronous API requests.

## Features

- Fetches random quotes from the Quotable API.
- Displays the fetched quote and author on the webpage.
- Allows users to fetch a new quote by clicking a button.
- Handles errors gracefully by displaying an error message if the API request fails.
